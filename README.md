# DMSGL: Real-Time EEG Emotion Recognition from Dynamic Mixed Spatiotemporal Graph Learning
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper "Real-Time EEG Emotion Recognition from Dynamic Mixed Spatiotemporal Graph Learning" accepted in ACMMM 2025.
# Overview
Due to the uncertainty and individual specificity of emotional cognition, there are still some challenges in achieving efficient online emotion decoding applications. To address this, in this work, we propose an online emotion decoding method named DMSGL (Real-Time EEG Emotion Recognition from Dynamic Mixed Spatiotemporal Graph Learning). With the DMSGL, the topological patterns and the stable dynamic temporal patterns existing in emotional EEG signals can be captured, and the real-time online emotion monitoring application can be implemented. The main contributions of this work are as follows:
- To model the complex brain connection network, we propose to utilize multi-view graph learning. Learning complementary graph structures from EEG signals.
- For the dynamic temporal patterns, DMSGL employs a dynamic mixed spatiotemporal graph network. Extracting spatiotemporal graph features from the graph features, and fusing the two branches to obtain robust representations.
- Based on this framework, we conduct extensive real-time emotion recognition experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed DMSGL can be effectively applied to real-time EEG emotion recognition.
